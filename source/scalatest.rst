ScalaTest
============

- almost like a meta-framework that supports a broad range of testing styles
- great way to get started with Scala as a team
- nonfunctional code, similar to writing build scripts in, say, Groovy (as in Gradlle)
- agile way to do Java!
- status of [ScalaTest shell](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=326389)?
